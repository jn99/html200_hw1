    <h1>Reponsive Web Design</h1>
    <p>The most critical requirement of a website nowadays is to be responsive. Responsive web design gives users dynamic websites that can render on any device and screen size. In the past, images and videos had to be approved with a certain size before development could begin. Today, web developers are free with their creation. We used to have to use laptop and carry it around just to access to a simple website because it would not work on our mobile, responsive design solved this problem. It took a while for a webpage that had heavy content to load, responsive design solved by loading content fist, then enhancements, then leftovers. There are three main browsers Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Firefox which used to load a certain website differently, and with their new versions today, most of browsers support CSS3 media queries that make the webpages to display properly. With responsive web design, developer can create the code once, then repeat it while making it better.  </p>
